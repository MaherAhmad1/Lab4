# Python IDLE
In order to keep things short and simple the difference between IDLE and Shell is that shell is a command line tool that starts up "Python Interpreter". With thiss you can write and test short/simple programs but in order to write more complex code and harder programs you need an editor within python. Idle is the best of both worlds because it already has everything that shell has and it also includes a text editor that can support your code. 

# Code Examples
A variable is the amount of space the computer will reserve for the code. Spam, bacon and eggs are oftern used in python tutorials because of the spam comedy sketch. An assignmeant statement will set or reset a value that has been stored, basically it copies a value into a variable. A function is code that is only able to be ran when you tell it to. Lastly the three types of datas are Integers, floating point nubers, and strings. 

# Graphics

### Rastor VS Vector
The two examples of grpahics in the section we read were raster and vector, lets talk about it. Raster is when you zoom in a picture and are able to make out the thousands or millions of pixels. On the other hand vector is when you are able to zoom in and lose zero quality to the image because it will be non pixalated and use a special form of geometry. The use of vector is best for when making logos, artwork, etchings, and stuff of that sort. The use of rastor is best used for non-line art, scanned artwork, detailed grpahics, and stuff of that sort. 

### Lossless VS Lossy Compression
The use of lossless vs Lossy is an important one to developers because they may be capped to a certain data limit and choosing whihch one they are able to use can let them spare resources to other departments that may need it more. 

### File Formats
There are a few different file formats that we read about in this section, they were jpg,gif, and png files. The similarities between all of them are that they all support the RGB color pallet, can support a decent amount of data in a file size, and are able to show animated or static pictures. The main differences between the three of them are that png uses lossless, jpeg uses lossy, and gif uses lossless as well. 

### File Properties
My image design was just the basic Gatorade logo because I had some near me and though it would be easy enough for someone with zero experience. The layers that it took to make were only 3 and it seems simple enough to make for anyone who wants to try. My file size was 284 Kb and the software used to open it was microsoft edge using an HTML document. I do not think there is a more appropiate application to open it with because edge is doing it just fine with zero problems. 

# Conclusion
This was a fun lab to go through and doing all of these things gave me a better understanding of how the real world computer industry opperates. Overall I think this was one of the more interactive lessons and it was an enjoyable experience.
