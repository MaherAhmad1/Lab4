# Python IDLE
In order to keep things short and simple the difference between IDLE and Shell is that shell is a command line tool that starts up "Python Interpreter". With thiss you can write and test short/simple programs but in order to write more complex code and harder programs you need an editor within python. Idle is the best of both worlds because it already has everything that shell has and it also includes a text editor that can support your code.
